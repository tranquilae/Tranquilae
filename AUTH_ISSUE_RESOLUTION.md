# 🔧 Authentication Issues Resolution

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**

The "Something went wrong" error on `/auth/signup` was caused by:

1. **Wrong Supabase Client**: Auth API routes were using client-side supabase instance
2. **Environment Variable Mismatch**: Client was configured for old JWT keys, but you're using new `sb_publishable_` and `sb_secret_` format
3. **Server-Side Auth Failure**: Auth operations require server-side client with secret key

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

### **1. Updated Auth API Routes**
- **`/api/auth/signup`**: Now uses server-side Supabase client with `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`
- **`/api/auth/login`**: Now uses server-side Supabase client with `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`
- **`/auth/callback`**: Updated to use new publishable key format

### **2. Environment Variable Support**
- All routes now support new Supabase API key format
- Fallback pattern: `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` → `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- Publishable keys: `PUBLISHABLE_DEFAULT_KEY` → `PUBLISHABLE_KEY` → `ANON_KEY`

### **3. Supabase Redirect URLs Guide**
- Added comprehensive guide for correct redirect URL configuration
- Identified issues with current setup

## 🎯 **Action Required - Fix Supabase Redirect URLs**

### **Current Issues in Your Supabase Config:**
❌ `/auth/confirm` doesn't exist (should be `/auth/callback`)  
❌ Missing `https://tranquilae.com/auth/callback` (non-www)  
❌ Missing localhost URLs for development  
❌ Wrong reset password redirect  

### **Replace with these 7 URLs:**
```
https://www.tranquilae.com
https://tranquilae.com
https://www.tranquilae.com/auth/callback
https://tranquilae.com/auth/callback
https://www.tranquilae.com/auth/login
http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
http://localhost:3000
```

## 🚀 **Expected Results After Fixes**

### **Immediate:**
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ No more "supabaseKey is required" errors
- ✅ Auth API routes use correct environment variables

### **After Supabase Redirect URL Fix:**
- ✅ `/auth/signup` should work without "Something went wrong"
- ✅ `/auth/login` should work properly
- ✅ Email confirmations should work
- ✅ Password resets should work
- ✅ Both www and non-www domains will work

### **After Vercel Environment Variables Set:**
- ✅ Red diagnostic box disappears
- ✅ All admin features work properly
- ✅ Production authentication flows work

## 📋 **Next Steps Checklist**

1. **✅ Code Fixed** - Auth routes now use server-side clients
2. **🔄 Deploy Triggered** - Vercel should auto-deploy the fixes
3. **⏳ Fix Supabase Redirect URLs** - Use the 7 URLs listed above
4. **⏳ Verify Vercel Environment Variables** - Ensure all 3 variables are set
5. **⏳ Test Authentication** - Try signup/login after deployment

## 🧪 **How to Test**

1. **Wait for Vercel deployment to complete**
2. **Fix Supabase redirect URLs first**
3. **Test signup flow:**
   - Go to your deployed site `/auth/signup`
   - Should no longer show "Something went wrong"
   - Should show proper signup form
4. **Test locally:**
   - `npm run dev`
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000/auth/signup`
   - Should work after redirect URL fix

## 💡 **Technical Details**

The issue was architectural: 
- **Before**: Auth routes used `import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase'` (client-side instance)
- **After**: Auth routes use `createClient()` with server-side secret key
- **Result**: Proper server-side authentication with new API key format

This ensures auth operations have elevated privileges needed for user creation and login.
