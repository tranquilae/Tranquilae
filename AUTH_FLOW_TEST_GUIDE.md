# 🔧 Auth Flow Testing Guide

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ Issues Resolved

1. **No credentials in URLs** - All authentication now uses secure POST requests
2. **Improved session persistence** - Better Supabase client configuration with AuthProvider
3. **Fixed middleware redirect loops** - Smart detection of auth flows to prevent session_expired redirects
4. **Enhanced API error handling** - Better session refresh and error recovery
5. **Proper redirect flow** - Correct routing: Signup → Onboarding → Dashboard, Login → Dashboard

### 🔧 Changes Made

#### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ **AuthProvider** (`components/auth-provider.tsx`) - Centralized session management
- ✅ **AuthGuard** (`components/auth-guard.tsx`) - Route protection component
- ✅ **Enhanced API client** (`lib/api.ts`) - Better session handling and error recovery
- ✅ **Improved middleware** (`middleware.ts`) - Smarter auth flow detection
- ✅ **Better auth forms** (`components/auth-form.tsx`) - Improved session establishment

#### Session Management
- ✅ **Automatic session refresh** in API calls
- ✅ **Client-side session persistence** with onAuthStateChange
- ✅ **Better error handling** for expired sessions
- ✅ **Reduced session_expired redirects** during auth flows

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Test 1: New User Signup Flow
```
Expected: Signup → Email Verification → Login → Onboarding → Dashboard
```

#### Steps:
1. [ ] Go to `/auth/signup`
2. [ ] Fill out signup form with valid details
3. [ ] Click "Create Account"
4. [ ] **Check**: Should redirect to `/auth/signup-success`
5. [ ] **Check**: No credentials visible in URL
6. [ ] **Check**: Console shows proper session handling
7. [ ] Verify email and click link
8. [ ] **Check**: Should redirect to onboarding or login
9. [ ] If redirected to login, sign in
10. [ ] **Check**: Should go to `/onboarding` (not dashboard)
11. [ ] Complete onboarding steps
12. [ ] **Check**: Final redirect should go to `/dashboard?onboarding=complete`

### Test 2: Returning User Login Flow
```
Expected: Login → Dashboard (skip onboarding)
```

#### Steps:
1. [ ] Go to `/auth/login`
2. [ ] Enter valid credentials
3. [ ] Click "Sign In"
4. [ ] **Check**: Should redirect directly to `/dashboard`
5. [ ] **Check**: No session_expired redirect
6. [ ] **Check**: No credentials visible in URL
7. [ ] **Check**: Console shows session established successfully

### Test 3: Onboarding Session Persistence
```
Expected: No session_expired redirects during onboarding
```

#### Steps:
1. [ ] Start onboarding flow (as new user)
2. [ ] Navigate through steps 1-3
3. [ ] **Check**: No redirect to `/auth/login?reason=session_expired`
4. [ ] **Check**: Console shows auth provider managing session
5. [ ] **Check**: API calls succeed without auth errors
6. [ ] Refresh page during onboarding
7. [ ] **Check**: Should stay in onboarding (with progress preserved)

### Test 4: Protected Route Access
```
Expected: Proper auth checks without redirect loops
```

#### Steps:
1. [ ] Open incognito/private window
2. [ ] Try to access `/dashboard` directly
3. [ ] **Check**: Should redirect to `/auth/login?redirectTo=/dashboard`
4. [ ] Sign in
5. [ ] **Check**: Should redirect back to `/dashboard`
6. [ ] Try to access `/onboarding` as completed user
7. [ ] **Check**: Should redirect appropriately based on onboarding status

### Test 5: API Error Handling
```
Expected: Better error recovery and session refresh
```

#### Steps:
1. [ ] Sign in successfully
2. [ ] Open browser dev tools → Application → Cookies
3. [ ] Delete Supabase session cookies
4. [ ] Try to make an API call (e.g., save onboarding progress)
5. [ ] **Check**: Should attempt session refresh automatically
6. [ ] **Check**: Should not immediately redirect to session_expired
7. [ ] **Check**: Console shows session refresh attempts

## 🔍 Debug Information

### Console Messages to Look For

#### ✅ Good Signs:
- `🔄 Auth state change: SIGNED_IN`
- `✅ User authenticated: <user-id>`
- `🏥 Health Integrations Updated:`
- `✅ Session set successfully`
- `🎯 Frontend: Redirecting to: <path>`

#### ❌ Warning Signs:
- `❌ Session verification failed`
- `API - No session available`
- `Middleware - Redirecting to login, no session`
- `session_expired` in URL repeatedly

### Browser Network Tab
- [ ] Auth API calls should be POST requests
- [ ] No credentials should appear in request URLs
- [ ] Session refresh attempts should be visible
- [ ] API calls should include proper Authorization headers

## 🚨 Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue: Session Takes Time to Initialize
**Symptom**: Brief "loading" state during auth
**Solution**: Added small delays in auth form for session establishment

### Issue: Onboarding Progress Lost on Refresh
**Symptom**: User returns to step 1 after refresh
**Solution**: Progress saved in localStorage and restored on mount

### Issue: Middleware Still Redirects Sometimes
**Symptom**: Occasional session_expired redirects
**Solution**: Enhanced middleware detection for auth flows

## 🛠️ Manual Testing Commands

### Check Supabase Client Status
```javascript
// Run in browser console
window.supabase = (await import('/lib/supabase')).supabase
const { data, error } = await window.supabase.auth.getSession()
console.log('Session:', data.session ? 'Active' : 'None', error)
```

### Check Auth Provider Status
```javascript
// Run in browser console after auth provider is loaded
// Look for auth state changes in console
```

### Check API Client
```javascript
// Run in browser console
const { fetchWithAuth } = await import('/lib/api')
try {
  const response = await fetchWithAuth('/api/user/profile')
  console.log('API call successful')
} catch (error) {
  console.log('API error:', error.message, error.code)
}
```
