# üè• Health App Integrations Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up all health app integrations for Tranquilae. Each integration allows users to sync their health data from popular fitness and wellness apps.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before setting up integrations, ensure you have:

- ‚úÖ **Tranquilae backend running** with database migrations completed
- ‚úÖ **Environment variables configured** (see `.env.example`)
- ‚úÖ **HTTPS domain** (required for OAuth callbacks in production)
- ‚úÖ **Admin access** to create developer accounts

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status

All health integrations are now **fully implemented** and ready for production:

- üü¢ **Google Fit** - Complete with OAuth, data sync, webhooks
- üü¢ **Fitbit** - Complete with rate limiting, intraday data support
- üü¢ **Apple Health** - FHIR API integration, iOS HealthKit ready
- üü¢ **Samsung Health** - Partner API integration, Android SDK ready
- üü¢ **Garmin Connect** - Full Connect IQ integration with wellness data
- üü¢ **Data Sync Engine** - Background jobs, deduplication, error handling
- üü¢ **Dashboard UI** - Complete integration management interface

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Run database migrations** to create integration tables:
```bash
npm run db:migrate
# or manually run: db.migrations.runAll()
```

2. **Add integration encryption key** to your `.env.local`:
```bash
# Generate a secure encryption key
openssl rand -hex 32
# Add to .env.local
INTEGRATION_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-generated-key-here"
```

3. **Choose which integrations to enable** and follow the setup guides below.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid OAuth state"**
   - Check your encryption key is set
   - Verify callback URLs match exactly
   - Check state parameter hasn't expired (10 minutes)

2. **"Token exchange failed"**
   - Verify client ID and secret are correct
   - Check OAuth application settings
   - Ensure callback URL is registered

3. **"Permission denied"**
   - Check API is enabled in developer console
   - Verify scopes are requested correctly
   - Ensure user has granted permissions

4. **"Rate limit exceeded"**
   - Check your API usage quotas
   - Implement exponential backoff
   - Consider upgrading API limits
