|------------|--------|-------------|
| **0-25** | ✅ Allow | Low risk, process normally |
| **26-50** | ⚠️ Monitor | Medium risk, track closely |
| **51-75** | 🔍 Review | High risk, manual review required |
| **76-100** | 🚫 Block | Very high risk, block transaction |

### 🔐 Webhook Security
```typescript
// Stripe webhook verification
✅ Cryptographic signature validation
✅ Timestamp verification (5-minute window)
✅ Event deduplication
✅ Automatic retry handling
✅ Error alerting and monitoring
```

---

## 🌐 API Security

### 🚦 Rate Limiting Strategy
```typescript
// Endpoint-specific rate limiting
/api/auth/*        → 5 requests/5min    (prevent brute force)
/api/checkout/*    → 3 requests/min     (prevent payment abuse)
/api/onboarding/*  → 10 requests/min    (reasonable progression)
/api/user/*        → 50 requests/min    (user data access)
/api/*             → 100 requests/min   (general API usage)
```

### 🛡️ Input Validation
```typescript
// Comprehensive validation with Zod
✅ Type validation (string, number, boolean, etc.)
✅ Format validation (email, UUID, URL, etc.)
✅ Range validation (min/max values)
✅ Content validation (allowed values, patterns)
✅ Sanitization (HTML, SQL, script injection)
```

### 🔒 API Authentication
```typescript
// JWT-based API authentication
1. Extract Bearer token from Authorization header
2. Verify JWT signature with Supabase public key
3. Check token expiration and validity
4. Extract user ID and permissions
5. Authorize specific endpoint access
```

### 📋 API Response Security
```typescript
// Secure API responses
✅ No sensitive data leakage
✅ Consistent error messages (no information disclosure)

✅ Storage limitation (delete when no longer needed)
✅ Data minimization (collect minimum required data)
✅ Accuracy (keep data up to date)
✅ Transparency (clear privacy policy)
```

## 📚 Developer Security Guidelines

### 🔒 Secure Coding Practices

#### Input Validation
```typescript
// Always validate and sanitize inputs
import { validators } from '@/lib/validation';

// ✅ Good: Validate all inputs
const userData = validators.userUpdate.parse(request.body);

// ❌ Bad: Trust user input
const userData = request.body; // Never do this!
```

#### Authentication Checks
```typescript
// Always verify user authentication
// ✅ Good: Check auth before processing
const userId = await verifyAuth(request);
if (!userId) {
  return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 });
}

// ❌ Bad: Assume user is authenticated
const userId = request.headers.get('x-user-id'); // Insecure!
```

#### Error Handling
```typescript
// Secure error handling
// ✅ Good: Generic error messages
return new Response('Invalid request', { status: 400 });

// ❌ Bad: Leak sensitive information
return new Response(`Database error: ${error.message}`, { status: 500 });
```

#### Secret Management
```typescript
// Proper secret handling
// ✅ Good: Environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY;

// ❌ Bad: Hardcoded secrets
const apiKey = 'sk_live_abc123...'; // Never do this!
```

### 🧪 Security Testing

#### Unit Tests
```typescript
// Test security functions
describe('Input Validation', () => {
  test('should reject malicious input', () => {
    expect(() => validators.userUpdate.parse({
      name: '<script>alert("xss")</script>'
    })).toThrow();
  });
});
```

#### Integration Tests
```typescript
// Test authentication flows
describe('Authentication', () => {
  test('should require auth for protected routes', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .get('/api/user/profile')
      .expect(401);
  });
});
```

### 📋 Code Review Guidelines

#### Security Review Checklist
- [ ] All inputs validated and sanitized
- [ ] Authentication/authorization checked
- [ ] No secrets hardcoded
- [ ] Error messages don't leak information
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Audit logging included

#### Common Security Issues to Avoid
```typescript
// ❌ SQL Injection
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;

// ✅ Use parameterized queries
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1';

// ❌ XSS Vulnerability
dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: userInput }}

// ✅ Sanitize user input
const cleanHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);

// ❌ Information Disclosure
throw new Error(`Database connection failed: ${dbError}`);

// ✅ Generic error messages
throw new Error('Service temporarily unavailable');
```
