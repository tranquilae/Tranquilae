# 🔄 JWT Secret Rotation - Diagnosis & Solution

## 🔍 **Current Diagnosis**

Based on the test results:

✅ **Publishable key works** - Client-side auth connections successful  
❌ **Secret key fails** - "Invalid API key" error  
⚠️ **Rate limit hit** - Signup attempts are reaching Supabase (good sign)  

## 🚨 **Most Likely Issue: JWT Secret Mismatch**

When using **new Supabase API keys** (`sb_publishable_` and `sb_secret_`), the JWT secret in Supabase needs to be compatible with these keys. 

### **The Problem:**
- You're using new API key format
- But JWT secret might still be configured for legacy keys
- This causes server-side operations to fail

## 🔧 **Solution: Rotate JWT Secret**

### **Step 1: Access JWT Configuration**
1. Go to: `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fspoavmvfymlunmfubqp/settings/api`
2. Scroll down to **"JWT Settings"**
3. Look for **"JWT Secret"**

### **Step 2: Generate New JWT Secret**
1. Click **"Generate new secret"** 
2. ⚠️ **WARNING**: This will invalidate all existing JWTs/sessions
3. This is necessary when switching to new API key format

### **Step 3: Update Environment Variable**
After rotation, you'll need to update:
```bash
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your_new_jwt_secret
```

### **Step 4: Redeploy**
- Update Vercel environment variables
- Redeploy your application

## 🧪 **Alternative Test: Skip JWT for Now**

Let's test if the issue is specifically JWT-related by testing signup without server-side operations:

### **Quick Test:**
1. **Temporarily disable** the user profile creation in signup
2. **Test pure Supabase auth** without database operations
3. **If this works**, it confirms JWT secret is the issue

## 📋 **Verification Checklist**

### **Before JWT Rotation:**
- [ ] Client-side auth works (✅ confirmed)
- [ ] Server-side auth fails (✅ confirmed) 
- [ ] Signup reaches Supabase but fails (✅ confirmed)

### **After JWT Rotation:**
- [ ] Server-side auth works
- [ ] Signup completes successfully
- [ ] User profile creation works
- [ ] Admin features work

## ⚡ **Immediate Action Required**

**The most likely fix is JWT secret rotation:**

1. **Backup**: Note your current JWT secret (just in case)
2. **Rotate**: Generate new JWT secret in Supabase dashboard
3. **Update**: Add new JWT secret to environment variables
4. **Deploy**: Redeploy with new secret

## 🔍 **How to Confirm This is the Issue**

Let me create a test that bypasses server-side operations to confirm the JWT hypothesis.

Would you like me to:
1. **Create a simplified signup test** that avoids server-side JWT operations?
2. **Walk you through JWT secret rotation** in Supabase?
3. **Both**?

The signup "Something went wrong" error is most likely happening because:
1. Frontend calls `/api/auth/signup`
2. API route tries to create user with server-side client
3. Server-side client fails due to JWT secret mismatch
4. API returns error
5. Frontend shows "Something went wrong"
